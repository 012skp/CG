# if you are using linux you can directly use 'a' executable file.
# to make 'a' executalbe command is:
$ chmod +x a



# 'a.cc' is the filename, compile it using c++11 or above version.
$ g++ -std=c++11 -o a a.cc
# this creates a executable file 'a'



# 'a' is the executable file which needs to pass command line argument 'test'.
# 'test' is a file containing input for program.
$ ./a test
# this prints the points of convex object that includes all convex objects given in input.



# you can edit 'test' file and give different inputs
# How to give inputs in 'test' file....?
# first line of 'test' file contain  an integer 'n' denoting the no of  convex objects.
# each of n successive objects is represented as follows.
# first line contains an integer 'm' denoting the no of points in convex objects.
# 'm' successive lines for each object contains co-ordinate 'xi' 'yi'.
# starting co-ordinate and ending co-ordinate of each convex object must be same.
# see the test file for more clearification.
